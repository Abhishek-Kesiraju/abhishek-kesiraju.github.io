      <h2>Why I’m Writing This Blog</h2>
      <div class="date">March 2025</div>
      <p>
        I wanted a place that feels slower than social media. A space where I can
        write honestly about my career, software engineering, learning curves, and the things
        we don’t usually talk about in tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is intentionally minimal — no ads, no noise, just thoughts over time.

      <h2>The First Switch</h2>
      <div class="date"> Ending notes - 2025</div>
      <p>
        After working for 3 years in Enterprise Payments.I had a lateral transition to a new domain for a team that is more development-intensive than Production support-intensive.
        It took me almost a year to prepare for this move. It was closely after the first 5 interviews, I started seeing the patterns and started realizing
        "Interviewing is its own muscle", it needs to be trained.<br>
        Some new rules that I setup for myself after overworking into burnout for the last two years.
        "Time & Health are the real currency". <br> Payments was indeed a great start for my career and it paid me with experience, a beginner's comfort cushion, and OG mentors that I will forever remember and cherish. I will try my best to stay in touch with them.

      <h2>First Month at CIAM</h2>
      <div class="date"> December - 2025</div>
        When I worked as a Programmer Analyst in IAM, before post-grad, I did not quite like the concept and motive of Identity and Access management. I was hesitant that CIAM was just another name for the same vertical. But they are two entirely different domains that probably share few security-related ideologies like  "CIA".<br><br>
        IAM - Identity and Access Management is focused on providing access to employee's of an org. Customer Identity and access Management deals with actual users of your software trying to make operations 
        and you're verifying people are who they claim to be and they have the right kind of access to do so.<br>
        I had an understanding of how OAuth works using JWT & PingFed at a high level for APIs to communicate with one another. But there seems to be a world of security stuff, which makes Authentication and Trust a platform of its own.
        Next things to learn so I can contribute well in this space are OAuth, OIDC, and SAML. Being able to integrate APIs with Okta, Auth0 etc

    <h2>Stick to the plan</h2>
    <div class="date"> 4 Days to new year</div>
      <p>
        As I prepare for Java 21 oracle certification, I seem to have a lot of thoughts overwhelming me...<br>
        There is so much to learn, and one step at a time feels extremely slow in a world where AI's are executing SWE tasks with a crazy level of accuracy.
        I wanted to learn Kotlin, so I can be a mobile developer, but then there's a AI skills to learn...<br>
        I was not ahead of the AI curve, and now Quantum computing started getting hype.
        I am yet to complete a cloud certification, because there is need for proof being able to use cloud, docker and kubernetes. 
        And then there's an endless list of side project folders, I never completed...
        <br><br>
        I guess... that is just a forever weight on the shoulders of being a software engineer in 2025. However, one thing at a time.
