      <h2>Why I’m Writing This Blog</h2>
      <div class="date">March 2025</div>
      <p>
        I wanted a place that feels slower than social media. A space where I can
        write honestly about my career, software engineering, learning curves, and the things
        we don’t usually talk about in tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is intentionally minimal — no ads, no noise, just thoughts over time.

      <h2>The First Switch</h2>
      <div class="date"> Ending notes - 2025</div>
      <p>
        After working for 3 years in Enterprise Payments.I had a lateral transition to a new domain for a team that is more development-intensive than Production support-intensive.
        It took me almost a year to prepare for this move. It was closely after the first 5 interviews, I started seeing the patterns and started realizing
        "Interviewing is its own muscle", it needs to be trained.<br>
        Some new rules that I setup for myself after overworking into burnout for the last two years.
        "Time & Health are the real currency". <br> Payments was indeed a great start for my career and it paid me with experience, a beginner's comfort cushion, and OG mentors that I will forever remember and cherish. I will try my best to stay in touch with them.

      <h2>First Month at CIAM</h2>
      <div class="date"> December - 2025</div>
        When I worked as a Programmer Analyst in IAM, before post-grad, I did not quite like the concept and motive of Identity and Access management. I was hesitant that CIAM was just another name for the same vertical. But they are two entirely different domains that probably share few security-related ideologies like  "CIA".<br><br>
        IAM - Identity and Access Management is focused on providing access to employee's of an org. Customer Identity and access Management deals with actual users of your software trying to make operations 
        and you're verifying people are who they claim to be and they have the right kind of access to do so.<br><br>
        I had an understanding of how OAuth works using JWT & PingFed at a high level for APIs to communicate with one another. But there seems to be a world of security stuff, which makes Authentication and Trust a platform of its own.
        Next things to learn so I can contribute well in this space are OAuth, OIDC, and SAML. Being able to integrate APIs with Okta, Auth0 etc

    <h2>Stick to the plan</h2>
    <div class="date">4 Days to new year</div>
      <p>
        As I prepare for Java 21 oracle certification, I seem to have a lot of thoughts overwhelming me...<br>
        There is so much to learn, and one step at a time feels extremely slow in a world where AI's are executing SWE tasks with a crazy level of accuracy.
        <br><br>
        I guess... I try not to be worried, but rather I want to leverage this trained intelligence as an assistant and a peer to make a better world.
        A better product for an everyday dad who takes care of his family, and does not have time to wonder if his money goes missing. People who feel it is
        very hard to use software rather than reaching a customer service representative for help.
        <br><br>
        I want to obsess over delivering an extremely safe and simple
        customer experience and traverse back to engineering rather than being obsessed over a great SE that is highly payable in the market.

    <h2>Jan 3rd 2025</h2>
    <div class="date"> Sessions </div>
      <p>
        A new range of complexity that feels very interesting when front-end gets involved and when your apps are customer-facing. "Sessions"
        A huge appreciation to people who worked on frameworks themselves that simplify handling sessions.
        <br><br>
        An interesting defect that I got to deliver in Prod last night, was a single line code change. 
        When user by mistake or purpose opens a second tab (2nd session) for doing an operation for the same app within a span of 30 mins...
        The 2nd session or even the nth one ends with an abrupt "something went wrong". 
        <br><br>
        And what's happening there? The app was generating a second session also with the same session-id as first. It was using stale context data of the first
        session rather than generating a new one, causing the app to end with an error. Solution was to clear any context before starting a new one.
